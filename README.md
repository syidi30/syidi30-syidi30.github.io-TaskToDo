# Student Task Manager (IMS566 Individual Project)

## Project Description
I decided to create a Student Task Manager and called the website TaskToDo, a task management system, which was developed with the view of assisting students in organizing their day-to-day work in a more systematic and effective manner. This system has addition, task status, marked as complete, and deleting options of tasks that are not required. Moreover, TaskToDo, the tasks are sorted into two categories and the categories are: Pending and Completed to ensure that the user watches his or her progress.
